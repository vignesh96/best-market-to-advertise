# Finding the Best market to advertise

We're working for an an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement. Our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in.

## Conclusion

In this project, we analyzed survey data from new coders to find the best two markets to advertise in. The only solid conclusion we reached is that the US would be a good market to advertise in.

For the second best market, it wasn't clear-cut what to choose between India and Canada. We decided to send the results to the marketing team so they can use their domain knowledge to take the best decision.
